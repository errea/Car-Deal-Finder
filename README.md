  ## Basics

1. Proper authenticated login.

* "My reservations".
* "Add Car that you selected as a theme"
* "Delete  Car that you selected as a theme" 


3. On the main page, the user can see a list of Car
When the user selects a specific item, they can see the details page with its full description

4. In the details page, the user can click the "Reserve" button .

When the user clicks the "Add item" link in the navigation panel they can see a form for adding a new item.

5. When the user clicks the "Delete item" link in the navigation panel they can see a list of all items with title and "Delete" button.
   
6. When the user clicks the "Delete" button, the selected item is marked as removed and does not show on the main list anymore.
   
7. To reserve an appointment, the user has to select a date and city (username and selected item are autofilled).


8. When the user clicks the "My reservations" link in the navigation panel they can see a list of their reservations (with information about item name, date and city)

9. Add full documentation for your API.

10. Implement proper user authentication from the front-end to the server.
Make sure that the "Add item" and "Delete item" links are accessible only by users who are admins.

># Technical set up
1. Set up the repository/repositories on GitHub and use Gitflow.

- On the project, GitHub page, navigate to the [main page of the repository](https://github.com/ccobasi/group-final-capstone)

- Click on a button named `code`

- Copy the project URL as displayed on HTTPS tab

- If you're running Windows Operating System, open your command prompt. On Linux, Open your terminal

- Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made. Leave as it is if the current location is where you want the project to be.

- Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.<br>

  `$ git clone https://github.com/ccobasi/group-final-capstone.git` <em>Press Enter key</em><br>

- Your local copy will be created.

- Please note that you must have Git installed on your PC, this can be done [here](https://gist.github.com/derhuerst/1b15ff4652a867391f03)

- After you get the project aiming to the desired directory, you need now to install dependencies by running npm install.


  ### Database Setup

- In your terminal, while in the root dir of your Rails project, type <code>bin/rails db:setup</code> to create your local databases, load the schema, and initialize with the seed data.

## Usage

1. In your terminal, run <code>bin/rails server</code> while inside the root directory of the repository files
2. Go to your browser of choice and enter this URL: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
3. \[Optional\] if you want to make changes to the JavaScript file and see changes immediately, run `./bin/webpack-dev-server`
4. Refresh the page to see a different greeting message! 😸

**Note:<br>_ These commands will not stop on their own. If you change something in your project files, it will recompile and reload the page in your browser. To exit, hit "ctrl + c"_**
